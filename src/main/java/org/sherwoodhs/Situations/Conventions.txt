1) For every situation, please put all the NPCs, Items, Locations, etc, involved at the top of the class.
2) Please make every situation a singleton with a private Scenario field, a private constructor, and a getInstance()
   method.
3) For the organization of situations :
    a) Create a package for a group of scenarios based on "quest line", "conversation", "sequence", etc.
        i)   Name this package with a very short description about this group. e.g. "MayorConversation" or
             "FinalBossFight"
        ii)  If there are multiple groups with similar names, add a number after package name. e.g. "MayorConversation3"
             or "FinalBossFight1"
    b) Put all scenarios involved in the package
        i)   Name these scenarios after the package + "_" + # in chain(zero-based). e.g. "MayorConversation3_0" or
             "FinalBossFight1_4"
        ii)  If there are scenarios that branch off and are mutually exclusive, add an addition "_" + #.
                1) For example, if a dialogue choice leads to two different responses. e.g. MayorConversation3_1_0
                   and MayorConversation3_1_1
        iii) Add a letter to the end denoting the type of situation. e.g. "MayorConversation3_1_0D" or
             "FinalBossFight3_1C"
                1) "D" represents Dialogue
                2) "C" represents Combat
                3) "I" represents Interaction
                4) "E" represents Default Exploration
4) If you want categorize Scenario packages (from 3.a), there isn't anything fancy that needs to be done. Just put them in the bigger package.
5) This may be subject to change based on our # of classes.
6) Please contact me, Derek, if you have any questions.

Package effectively means folder.
1) For every situation, please put all the NPCs, Items, Locations, etc, involved at the top of the class.
2) Please make every situation a singleton with a private Scenario field, a private constructor, and a getInstance()
   method.
3) Above the class declaration, please give a brief description in comments denoting what the situation does, the
   "requirements", and its place in the world timeline.
4) For the organization of situations :
    a) Create a package for a group of scenarios based on "quest line", "conversation", "sequence", etc.
        i)   Name this package with a very short description about this group. e.g. "MayorConversation" or
             "FinalBossFight"
        ii)  If there are multiple groups with similar names, add a number after package name. e.g. "MayorConversation3"
             or "FinalBossFight1"
    b) Put all scenarios involved in the package
        i)   Name these scenarios after the package + "_" + # in chain(zero-based). e.g. "MayorConversation3_0" or
             "FinalBossFight1_4". If there is only one scenario in the chain, you do not have to add this.
        ii)  If there are scenarios that branch off and are mutually exclusive, add an addition "_" + #.
                1) For example, if a dialogue choice leads to two different responses. e.g. MayorConversation3_1_0
                   and MayorConversation3_1_1
        iii) Add a letter to the end denoting the type of situation. e.g. "MayorConversation3_1_0D" or
             "FinalBossFight3_1C"
                1) "D" represents Dialogue
                2) "C" represents Combat
                3) "I" represents Interaction
                4) "E" represents Default Exploration
                5) "End" represents Ending.
5) If you want to categorize Scenario packages (from 3.a), there isn't anything fancy that needs to be done. Just put
   them in the bigger package.
6) The LocationOptions Package is simply just the default scenario when moving between locations. These scenarios are
   can branch off to other scenario options based on conditions.
7) This may be subject to change based on our # of classes.
